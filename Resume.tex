				{Developer}
				{2018 - 2019}
				{Joined a small start-up in the Real Estate / Digital Marketing space in Geelong as the 3rd developer. While there I took the following initiatives:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Rewrote the email template engine, cutting development time from 1 week to a day per template. This system needed to allow each template to be styled and branded differently, as well as provide some rudimentary logic. This included separating out the data from the visuals, and providing a layer that ensures that email compatible HTML / CSS is produced.
					\item Learned and used GraphQL and Laravel to rebuild the mobile app's backend from scratch.
					\item Helped the team rewrite old code into new maintainable modules, including starting to write unit tests, and incorporate proper git processes (code reviews, better branch management) and start using Jira to manage sprints.
				\end{itemize}

				{Restful API made in mode, connecting to a mongoDB instance. This project uses the mongoose, and express packages. The database is also on my github (https://github.com/CrimsonNynja/monster-hunter-DB) This was made to learn some Node, and to provide a foundation for another react project i have in the works}

				{Made a bare bones engine written in \CC \ using the SFML library, to help solidify some lower level programming concepts. It is built using the Entity Component System design pattern, and includes features such as: logging, animation, asset handling, gamestates and more.}

				{PHP Tree\newline Library}
				{https://github.com/CrimsonNynja/PHP-Trees}
				{}
				{Library for PHP that adds tree structures. The trees are designed to seamlessly work within the language, utilizing the latest PHP features. Full unit tests are also provided, written in PHP Unit, and built with PSR in mind. The latest release is also available as a composer package. I built this as PHP does not have any trees structure in its core, and there is no library that I can find for structure like a Rope. }
