				{RMS Cloud}
				{Lead Developer}
				{2025 - Current}
				{Joined to assist a company in the hotel and booking space in transitioning a legacy system to a more modern one, as well as help move the company to use agile practices.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Brought the existing react app up to a modern standard, introducing typescript, unit tests and linting
					\item Architected a new map experience, making use of MapLibre
					\item Designed the companies Design System, working closely with the UI team. This is built on Linaria, and aimed to standardise the way CSS was written within the existing app, while creating standard components.
				\end{itemize}

				{REA Group}
				{Senior Developer}
				{2021 - 2024}
				{Moved over to the financial services side of the business as a senior developer, focusing on the front end. Through this I've been part of a major uplift to a new design system and the change in banking partners off of NAB. I also led work on a loan comparison tool. 
			During this period, I also moved to the consumer side of the business, working directly on the main realestate.com.au site. While here, I have seen the release of a number of new features to the site, moved the main website to use more modern technology, and assisted with federated work.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Was successful in removing the squads legacy UI components(CSS, heavy use of external dependencies), and replacing them with the design systems(React, styled-components) throughout the financial services. This both reduced the bundle sizes, fixed many discrepancies within the UI, improved accessibility, and reduced the amount of systems we needed to maintain
					\item Lead large parts of a major UI uplift within financial services (react, design systems)
					\item Lead a piece of work to add home loan comparisons to the main site. This was written in React, urql(graphql), styled-components, AWS with node.js, cloudwatch, and also involved modernisation of the existing repo, moving off of flow and onto typescript
					\item Ran an initiative to move the main site off of mocha/enzyme and onto jest/react-testing-library. Also lead the transition of this site to typescript off of flow
					\item Rewrote a legacy system(jQuery, backbone.js) that saves collections of properties to one that uses a modern tech stack, based on react, urql(graphql). This was also moved to use the companies design system, and turned into a micro frontend
					\item Helped with federation from other teams into the main site, and mentored junior team members.
				\end{itemize}

				{REA Group}
				{Developer}
				{2020 - 2021}
				{Joined REA as the first Melbourne developer in the mortgage side of the business. Through this I saw the completion of a major system to service loans, a refocus to migrate large amounts of legacy data to a new modern system, the integration of Salesforce and acquisition of Mortgage choice.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Lead a successful adoption of standard company component libraries within the mortgage servicing frontend system, bringing the look of the system in line with the rest of REA.
					\item Developed documentation and maintained the squads onboarding wiki.
					\item Reduced build times for most repos by a significant amount
					\item Lead the rollback strategy for a salesforce data migration. This migration was a year long endeavour, containing financial and mortgage data that was also used to pay the mortgage brokers. 
					\item Wrote AWS infrastructure in node.js for a massive data migration piece of work. This involved many facets of AWS including SQS, Lambda, cloudwatch, Dead Letter Ques
					\item Maintained and wrote mortgage/loan logic in Java, also using springboot
